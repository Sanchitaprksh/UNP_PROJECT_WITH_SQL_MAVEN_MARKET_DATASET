# UNP_PROJECT_WITH_SQL_MAVEN_MARKET_DATASET

As part of an internship with UNP Education, our team undertook a SQL-based data analytics project using the Maven Market retail dataset. We designed a well-structured relational database with interconnected tables for Customers, Products, Stores, Regions, Returns, and Transactions. The data was imported from backup tables, thoroughly cleaned, and normalized to eliminate redundancy and ensure consistency. Primary and foreign key relationships were established to maintain data integrity across all entities. We developed a series of optimized SQL queries to extract actionable business insights, including average product cost, store-wise and region-wise sales, customer distribution by marital status and income group, total revenue, average product weight, top returned products, transaction volumes, and revenue analysis based on membership types. These insights provided a comprehensive view of sales performance, customer behavior, and regional trends. The project enhanced our practical skills in MySQL, relational database management, and applying real-world analytics to support strategic business decisions.
